# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis


## Overview of the analysis:

This Analysis was performed in order to plan for the future staffing needs of the Pewelerr Hackard firm. In order to plan how best to prepare the company for the upcoming wave of retirements, this analysis looked at what departments had the most retirees and would need to be prepared. 

## Results
After reviewing the data on employees at the company it was determined that a solution would need to be put together to avoid the company losing its wealth of knowledge. By assessing the information there were a few key insights into who the company should look to retain as mentos and who they should begin offering retirement packages to.

Key actions:
- Make mentorship offers to the eligible employees
- Focus on retaining mentors that are Senior Staff and Senior Engineers (based on Fig1)
- Increase recruiting for Engineer and Staff positions in order to fill the roles of the retiring Senior Staff/Engineers
- Select the staff that does not want to Mentor to offer retirement packages to.

## Summary

Overall the company should be discerning with who they offer retirement packages to and who they slect to mentor new talent. They can use their assets to help set up their continued success if heeding the data's insight. Moving forward they could also look at how the salaries align to the positions that are retiring. It would be best to offer the packages to the highest earners and retain the lower salary workes to complete mentorships. An additional query would be to align on what departments need the most support and build cross functional relationships within them to further the companies success.
